The first is the classic tool, `matplotlib`, which was an adaptation in the plotting tools from matplotlib (if you don't already have matplotlib installed, run `pip install matplotlib`). The second tool is `seaborn` which is newer module that allows to produce figures with less effort, similar to `ggplot2` in `R`.\n",
